This was a project originally made for a university assignment (USYD SOFT3202). To run, build with gradle and call main(). 

The idea behind the program is a GUI made with JavaFX to allow for visual exploration of a API. The key features include:
- The application of a Model-View-Controller framework for the application.
- Usage of the JavaFX library for the GUI.
- Usage of JSON to store search history for export.
- Usage of the http library for API access, both to import data from the Marvel API and to export data using Twilio's to Reddit and Mobile.
- The use of caching to minimise API calls.
